## Preparation

* To set up the development environment, you need to install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) package manager and GNU Make.
* Run `make help` to get available commands.

## Codestyle

## Releases

* Release versions SHOULD conform to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Releases that introduce breaking changes MUST be major ones.

## Documentation

* All changes that affect user experience MUST be documented in CHANGELOG.md file.
* Changelog formatting SHOULD stick to GitLab changelog [guidelines](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/changelog.html).
